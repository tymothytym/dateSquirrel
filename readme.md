# dateSquirrel
A date picker with a nutty tang
##### Release: Version: 0.3.3
##### In master: Version: 0.3.3

dateSquirrel is a date picker with calendar dates. It's modal-free, dependency-free, library-free and free-free. The aim is to put the date picking into a single field and make it so you can pick any date in three clicks. It's not trying to be better than other date pickers, just a bit different. dateSquirrel is for wide date possibilities (like date of birth) that are a pain to pick when you have to navigate through several decades worth of months to get to the date you want.

## Before you get started
<a name="monthsStart"/></a>
### Months start at 0
dateSquirrel gets all it's information from the JavaScripts [Date.prototype](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/prototype) which means that when you give it date information, it's expecting the format to match that of the `Date` object.

1. `Date` objects are in the format: YEAR, MONTH, DAY
2. YEAR, MONTH & DAY are all **numbers**
3. **Months start at 0 when using** `Date` objects - January === 0 and December === 11 
4. (But dateSquirrel will parse the dates it outputs as you [specify](#formatting))

So if you wanted to have the 7th of March 1983 as a `Date` object:

```javascript
const myDate = new Date(1983,2,7) // Mon Mar 07 1983 00:00:00
```

However if you were to get the same date back from a user (via dateSquirrel) in, say, `dd/mm/yyyy` [format](#formatting)), then you would get `07/03/1983` (Monday 7th March 1983).

It's not because dateSquirrel was made by a crazy person (that's simply a coincidence), it's one of the legacy hangups of JavaScript. [Blame `java.util.Date` apparently](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2552483/why-does-the-month-argument-range-from-0-to-11-in-javascripts-date-constructor#answer-41992352).

<a name="dsqWhut"/></a>
### dateSquirrel sees days as indivisible
When you give dateSquirrel a date it assumes two things right off the bat:

1. You mean the **whole** of that day regardless of any time you may indicate
2. You want to **include** that day in whatever circumstance you're identifying (e.g day-a to day-n **includes** both day-a and day-n)

This means that if you asked for a range from now to 5 days hence, but excluding the third day, you would only need to indicate a point at any time during a day to indicate the whole day. e.g.

```javascript
const today = new Date(),
    // current time and date
    endDate = new Date(today.getFullYear(), today.getMonth(), today.getDate() + 5),
    // 5 days hence at 00:00:00
    dayThree = new Date(today.getFullYear(), today.getMonth(), today.getDate() + 3),
    // 3 days hence at 00:00:00
```

<a name="Browser"/></a>
### Browser support

dateSquirrel supports recent(ish) browsers but needs access to the newer (but not bleeding-edge) JavaScript DOM methods & properties; [`Element.querySelector()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/querySelector), [`EventTarget.addEventListener()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) and [`Element.classList`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList).

<a name="Use"/></a>
## Use

<a name="Deployment"/></a>
### Deployment

#### Add the library

dateSquirrel has no dependencies and you can initialise it in a number of flavours to suit your build.

##### Via HTML tag

Include the script tag in the `<body>` (or `<head>` tag) and add the css to the `<head>` tag then add your date inputs to the `<body>`.

```html
<body>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/dsq.min.css">
    </head>
	<!-- page HTML -->
	<label for="#myDateInput">My label</label>
    <input id="myDateInput" type="date" min="2017-04-01" max="2017-04-30" placeholder="Pick a date">
	<!-- more page HTML -->
	<script>path/to/dsq.js</script>
	<!-- other scripts that are dependent on dsq -->
	<script>
		new dsq('#myDateInput');
	</script>
</body>
```

##### ES2015 (formerly known as ES6) module import

```javascript
import dsq from './path/to/dsq.js';
new dsq('#myDateInput');
```

##### CommonJS module require

```javascript
var dsq = require('./path/to/dsq.min.js');
new dsq('#myDateInput');
```

##### AMD module require

```javascript
require(['dsq'], function (dsq) {
  // ...
  new dsq('#myDateInput');
});
```

#### Initialising dateSquirrel in your JavaScript: 

```javascript
new dsq('#myDateInput'); // as a static entity

var myDateSquirrel = new dsq('#myDateInput'); // as a manipulable object
```

N.B. It's recommended that you wrap the initialisation code in a listener that waits for the DOM to load before triggering if your input(s) are dynamically created

```javascript
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() { // Listen for DOM to be ready
	new dsq('#myDateInput'); // create new dateSquirrel instance
});
```

Don't forget to [set your options](#Options) if you don't like the defaults.

```javascript
new dsq('#myDateInput', {
   pattern: 'dx mmm yyyy' 
});
```

<a name="FYIs"/></a>
### Usage in your build FYIs

- Styling for fallbacks or [non-activating](#Activation) scenarios is not included, so you have to add your own (S)CSS for that
- Resetting and / or normalisation of your page styles is assumed

<a name="Options"/></a>
## Options

```javascript
const defaults = { // dsq defaults
    start: new Date(), // first selectable day
    end: { // last selectable day
        d: new Date().getDate(),
        m: new Date().getMonth(),
        y: new Date().getFullYear() + 10
    },
    initial: false, // set the value the field should be set to on initialisation (before user input)
    pattern: 'dx mmm yyyy', // visual output format (displayed in the input) 
    patternSave: 'yyyy-mm-dd', // data-date value output format 
    day: true, // if true then a day is selectable
    month: true, // if true then a month is selectable
    disableDates: false, // a list of Date objects or ranges [from, to] that define days to exclude as selectable
    markToday: true, // if true then the "today" indicator is shown
    classPrefix: 'dsq-', // prefix JS-added classes - if changed scss variable "$dsq-prefix" must be updated too
    hideScrollbars: false, // if true then a scrollbars on year and month list are hidden (visual effect)
    activation: function() {return true}, // if the function evaluates to true when DOM loads then dateSquirrel activates
    callback: function() {}, // optional callback fired on date completion
        //console.log('Date set: ', this.date);
        //console.log('The input element: ', this.input);
        //console.log('The dateSquirrel wrapper: ', this.wrapper);
    parse: {
    	active: true, // if true dateSquirrel will (after [parseDelay]ms) parse, format and rewrite a user given date
    	delay: 100, // the delay in ms before dateSquirrel will parse, format and rewrite a user given date
    	etype: 'change', // the type of event dateSquirrel will listen for before parsing >> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events
    	rule: 'dmy' // the expected order a user will input a date (default = day > month > year)
    },
    overlay: false, // if true dateSquirrel will position the generated submenus absolutely
    monthList: ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'] // The list of months
};
```

<a name="startEnd"/></a>
### `start` & `end` (array, function, Date)
The start and end of the range the user can select from. The range **includes** the start and end day.

#### Can be set with...
##### Numbers 
Where `d` = day, `m` = month and `y` = year

```javascript
    // with literal dates
    new dsq('#eg0', {
        start: {
            d: 28, // the 28th day
            m: 1, // the SECOND month (February)
            y: 1990 // the full year
        },
        end: {
            d: 1, // the 1st day
            m: 6, // the SEVENTH month (July)
            y: 2000 // the full year
        } 
    });
```

##### Functions (that return numbers)

```javascript
    var today = new Date();
    new dsq('#eg1', {
        start: {
            d: 1, // Beginning of the month (1st)
            m: today.getMonth(), // Today's month
            y: today.getFullYear() + 1 // next year
        } 
    });

    // note: dsq automatically changes impossible dates **downward** to the nearest possible value 
    {
        d: 31, // becomes => 29
        m: 1, // February
        y: 2364 // leap year
        // result = 29th Feb 2364
    } 
    // or even:
    {
        d: 34, // becomes => 31
        m: 15, // becomes => 11 (December)
        y: 1999
        // result = 31st Dec 1999
    } 
```

##### `Date()` objects

```javascript
    new dsq('#eg2', {
        start: new Date(new Date().getFullYear() - 10, new Date().getMonth(), new Date().getDate()) 
        // ten years ago
    });

    // note: ranges INCLUDE start and end day
    // note: Months are expected as: 0 = Jan, 1 = Feb, 2 = Mar..., 11 = Dec
```
<a name="initial"/></a>
### `initial` (text)
The initial date (visible to the user and programatically set) an input will be set to. dateSquirrel will use the `pattern` option to determine the visual and stored formats.

```javascript
    new dsq('#eg03', {
        initial: '4/12/2022', // e.g. Monday, 4th December 2022
    });
```
##### Caveats!
- dateSquirrel doesn't check to see if the initial date is within the range specified (you can use the [`isBetweenDates`](#isBetweenDates) function to check prior to passing to dateSquirrel if you need to)
- dateSquirrel will try and parse the entered date using it's internal parser: this accepts a **UK date format** like dd-mm-yyyy, dd mm yyyy, dd/mm/yy by default but can be changed via the `parse.rule` option to accomodate other syntaxes

<a name="pattern"/></a>
### `pattern` & `patternSave` (text)
Sets the pattern that is displayed in the `<input>` (`pattern`) or the pattern saved to the `data-dsq-date` attribute of the `<input>`. [Pattern syntax and available formats](#formatting)

```javascript
    new dsq('#eg3', {
        pattern: 'wwww, dx mmmm yyyy', // e.g. Monday, 4th December 2017
        patternSave: 'd/m/yyyy', // e.g. 4/12/2017
    });
```

<a name="day"/></a>
### `day` (boolean)
If set to `false` dateSquirrel **won't** prompt the user for a day and will assume that it should be the 1st of any selected month for the purposes of any callback or output. You can remove the day from the output with `pattern` &/or `patternSave`. (default `true`)


<a name="month"/></a>
### `month` (boolean)
If set to `false` dateSquirrel **won't** prompt the user for a month and will assume that it should be the 1st of January for any selected year for the purposes of any callback or output. You can remove the month (& day) from the output with `pattern` &/or `patternSave`. Setting `month` to `false` also sets `day` to `false`. (default `true`)

N.B. There is no "year" option as you can disable that by setting the range (`start` & `end`) to be less than a year

<a name="disableDates"/></a>
### `disableDates` (array [number, Date, text])
Disable days, months, years, date ranges and recurring dates within the `start` & `end` range so they can't be selected by the user. Ranges and / or recurring dates can overlap.

```javascript
new dsq('#eg4', {
    disabledDates: [
        "wed", // recurring days ("mon", "tue",..., "sun")
        "11/25", // recurring dates ("mm/dd" n.b. 00/01 === January 1st)
        new Date(2019, 0, 31), // single dates (Date objects)
        [new Date(2008,3,15), new Date(2009,4,14)], // date ranges ([start, end]) N.B. inclusive of start and end dates
        2006, // whole years (1999, 2000,..., 2999)
        5 // recurring months (0, 1,..., 11)
    ]
});
```

#### text (recurring days and dates)
Dates that occur at regular intervals can be disabled either by day of the week - in the format `www` - or date - in the format `mm/dd`. These disable all instances of that day or date throughout the available range (between `start` & `end`).

```javascript
new dsq('#eg5', {
    disabledDates: [
        "wed", // recurring days ("mon", "tue",..., "sun")
        "11/25", // recurring dates ("mm/dd" n.b. 00/01 === January 1st)
    ]
});
```

#### number (Whole years and recurring months)
Disables the whole of a month (recurring) or year so it (and its child-days) can't be selected by the user.

```javascript
new dsq('#eg6', {
    disabledDates: [
        2006, // whole years (1999, 2000,..., 2999)
        5 // recurring months (0, 1,..., 11)
    ]
});
```

#### Single Date objects and ranges specified by Date objects
Specifies a single day to be disabled.

```javascript
new dsq('#eg7', {
    disabledDates: [
        new Date(2019, 0, 31), // 31st of January 2019
    ]
});
```

#### Date ranges specified by Date objects
Specifies a continuous range of days to be disabled.

```javascript
new dsq('#eg7', {
    disabledDates: [
        [new Date(2008,3,15), new Date(2009,4,14)], // From the 15th of April 2008 to the 14th of May 2009
    ]
});
```

N.B. inclusive of start and end dates

<a name="markToday"/></a>
### `markToday` (boolean)
If set to `false` the indicator on the list of days showing the current day is disabled. (default `true`)

<a name="hideScrollbars"/></a>
### `hideScrollbars` (boolean)
If set to `true`; hides the native scrollbars inside dateSquirrel.

```javascript
new dsq('#eg10', {
    hideScrollbars: false
});
```

**WARNING - Disabling scrollbars without replacement indicators / functionality can damage user experience**

<a name="activation"/></a>
### `activation` (function)
dateSquirrel checks this function to see if it should activate when it first loads. If the function returns `true` then it activates.

```javascript
new dsq('#eg11', {
    activation: function() { // if the function evaluates to true then dateSquirrel activates
        if (window.screen.width > 319) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
});
```

N.B. This function only runs on initial activation, not on window resize.

<a name="callback"/></a>
### `callback` (function)
A custom function fired when and attempt is made (successful or otherwise) to set a date. Provides five key constants from dateSquirrel as set at the time of the callback.

```javascript
new dsq('#eg12', {
    callback: function() {
        console.log('Date set: ', this.date); // undefined if unsuccessful
        console.log('The input element: ', this.input);
        console.log('The dateSquirrel wrapper: ', this.wrapper);
        console.log('Date in human format: ', this.human); // undefined if unsuccessful
        console.log('Date in save format: ', this.save); // undefined if unsuccessful
    }
});
```

#### Constants available in the callback function

| Constant | Description | Type | Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `this.date` | Date set | Date | 'Wed Nov 13 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (GMT Standard Time)' |
| `this.input` | The `<input>` element | DOM element | <input type="text" id="eg12"... | 
| `this.wrapper` | The `<div>` element added by dateSquirrel | DOM element | <div class="dsq"... | 
| `this.human` | The date set in the format specified by `pattern` | text | "13th Nov 2024" | 
| `this.save` | The date set in the format specified by `patternSave` | text | "2024,11,13" | 

<a name="formatting"/></a>
## Date output formatting

| Syntax | Description | Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| d | Day of month | 1, 2, ..., 31 |
| dx | Day of month with ordinal suffix | 1st, 2nd, ..., 31st | 
| dd | Day of month with leading zero (if required) | 01, 02, ..., 31 | 
| w | Day of week (numeric) | 0, 1, ..., 6 | 
| ww | Day of week abbreviated to two letters | Su, Mo, ..., Sa | 
| www | Day of week abbreviated to three letters | Sun, Mon, ..., Sat |
| wwww | Day of week unabbreviated | Sunday, Monday, ..., Saturday |
| m | The month | 1, 2, ..., 12 | 
| mx | The month with ordinal suffix | 1st, 2nd, ..., 12th | 
| mm | The month with leading zero if required. | 01, 02, ..., 12 | 
| mmm | The month abbreviated to three letters | Jan, Feb, ..., Dec |  
| mmmm | The month unabbreviated | January, February, ..., December | 
| yy | The year abbreviated | 00, 01, 02, ..., 99 | 
| yyyy | The year unabbreviated | 1900, 1901, 1902, ..., 1999 | 

**N.B. The dateSquirrel formatter returns dates in human-readable formats. e.g. January = 1 or 01**

<a name="parse"/></a>
### `parse` (object)

dateSquirrel can attempt to parse a date into your [requested format](#pattern) on an input event (`parse.etype` - e.g. 'change' or 'blur'). You can also optionally specify a delay (`parse.delay`) in milliseconds (1000ms === 1s) before parsing happens. If this option is set to `true` (default) dateSquirrel will also try and parse the input immediately when a user presses the return key, regardless of any delay set.

`parse` assumes a user wouldn't put in the day of the week (e.g. Wednesday) when asked for a date and would only use date (e.g. 1st), month & year when typing in an answer.

```javascript
new dsq('#eg18', {
	parse: {
    	active: true, // if true dateSquirrel will parse, format and rewrite a user given date
    	delay: 100, // the delay in ms before dateSquirrel will parse, format and rewrite
    	etype: 'change', // the type of event dateSquirrel will listen for
    	rule: 'dmy' // the expected order a user will input a date in (default = day > month > year)
    },
});
```

<a name="overlay"/></a>
### `overlay` (boolean)

dateSquirrel likes to keep all its submenus in the page to aid accessibility and because it's neat. If you'd prefer to have floaty stuff doing it's thing, then you can change the submenus to absolutely positioned overlays by setting `overlay: true`

```javascript
new dsq('#eg19', {
	overlay: true
});
```
<a name="Methods"/></a>
## Methods, setters & getters

dateSquirrel has a few ways you can use to modify an existing instance or get things from it. **All methods assume you have attached the instance to a JavaScript variable like so**:

```javascript
const myDsq = new dsq('#theInputsId', options);
```

<a name="destroy"/></a>
### Destroy an instance

#### Use

```javascript
myDsq.destroy();
``` 
#### Returns

Sense of foreboding

#### Arguments

| Argument | Description | Type | Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| none | nemo | keiner | hakuna |

#### Description

Removes all listeners and additional HTML added by dateSquirrel and returns the `<input>` field and `<label>` to the state it found them in. Doesn't accept arguments.

#### Example

```javascript
const myDsq = new dsq('#theInputsId', options);
myDsq.destroy();
```  

<a name="getValue"/></a>
### Get the current value 

#### Use

```javascript
myDsq.getValue([pattern]);
``` 
#### Returns

Date object or string

#### Arguments

| Argument | Description | Type | Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| pattern | The date to modify | text string | `'dx of mmmm, yyyy'` |

#### Description

dateSquirrel doesn't mess with the standard `element.value` so you can use that to get the human-readable value (same format as `options.pattern`) if you like. However you might want something a bit spicier so you can get the `Date` object with:

#### Example

```javascript
const myDsq = new dsq('#theInputsId', options);

console.log(myDsq.getValue());
``` 

##### But wait; there's more

As dateSquirrel has a date formatter, like, [right there](#format), it seemed churlish to not to use it. Pass a [pattern](#formatting) as a parameter (e.g. `'dd-mm-yy'`) and dateSquirrel will format the value and return it as a string.

```javascript
const myDsq = new dsq('#theInputsId', options);

console.log(myDsq.getValue('wwww the dx')); // e.g. 'Wednesday the 6th'
``` 
<a name="setValue"/></a>
### Set the current value 

**This function expects a human readable date in UK format (01/02/2003, 1st Feb 2003, 01.02.03) by default**

```javascript
myDsq.setValue(valueAsString [, zoneOrder]);
``` 

#### Returns

`true` if successful & `false` if unsuccessful

#### Arguments

| Argument | Description | Type | Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| valueAsString | The date to set | text string | `'1-1-01'` |
| zoneOrder | day, month, year order expected | 3 char text string | `'dmy'` |

#### Description

This function simply sets the visible and programatic values of the input filed and dateSquirrel to the given date. It expects a string but you can use the [inbuilt parser](#format) if you need to convert from an object.

#### Examples

```javascript
const myDsq = new dsq('#theInputsId');

myDsq.setValue('31.01.2001'); // 31st Jan 2001

// or with a Date object

const newDate = new Date(1,0,2001);

myDsq.setValue(dsq.format(newDate,'dd/mm/yyyy')); // 1st Jan 2001
``` 
If you're expecting the user to enter a date in another format then you can alter the parsers behaviour based on the expected syntax. Basically if you're expecting an American style date (June 4th 2009, 6/4/09, 06 04 2009, etc.) you would set `zoneOrder` to `'mdy'` or "month" then "day" then "year". If you only cater for people in the ISO compliance department then maybe you'd opt for `'ymd'` (year > month > day). You must include `y`, `m` & `d` with `zoneOrder`. You will probably also want to set the output [`pattern`](#pattern) when changing `zoneOrder` as dateSquirrel will otherwise return the standard (UK) `pattern`.

```javascript
const myDsq = new dsq('#theInputsId', {
		pattern: mmm dx yyyy
	});

myDsq.setValue('01/31/2001', 'mdy'); // Jan 31st 2001
```

## Helper functions

dateSquirrel uses a bunch of micro-functions to work out dates and ranges and stuff like that. Since they are not doing anything in particular in their downtime, they have been exposed so you can use them in your own code as date helpers. All these functions operate with no impact on any instance of dateSquirrel and don't require an instance on the page to work.

<a name="modMonths"/></a>
### Change date by `n` months
```javascript
dsq.modMonths(date, modBy)
```

Modifies a date by a number of months (positive or negative).

| Argument | Description | Type | Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| date | The date to modify | Date Object | `new Date()` |
| modBy | The number of months to increase (+) or decrease (-) by | number | -n, ..., -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, ..., n |


```javascript
const someDay = new Date(2000, 0, 1);

console.log(dsq.modMonths(someDay, -1)); // Wed Dec 01 1999
```

<a name="countMonths"/></a>
### Count months between dates
```javascript
dsq.countMonths(startDate, endDate [, whole])
```

Counts the number of (optionally whole) calendar months between two dates. 

| Argument | Description | Type | Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| startDate | The date to count from | Date Object | `new Date()` |
| endDate | The date to count to | Date Object | `new Date()` |
| whole | Whether to return whole months (1st to nth) or months (yth to yth) counted | boolean | `true` or `false` |

#### `whole` (optional)
When `whole` is set to `true` dateSquirrel looks to see if the 1st to the nth (28th-31st) of the month are included in their entirety before counting a month. In the example below setting `whole` to `true` means that the first "whole" month is counted on Feb (month 1) the 29th (it was a leap year) 2000 and the last one is counted on Nov (month 10) the 31st 2003. However if `whole` is set to `false` (default setting if omitted) then the first month is counted on Feb (month 1) the **20th**and the last is counted on **Dec (month 11)** the **20th** 2003. So setting to false in this instance means an additional month counted.

```javascript
const someDay = new Date(2000, 0, 20),
    someOtherDay = new Date(2003, 11, 21);

console.log(dsq.countMonths(someDay, someOtherDay, true)); // 46
console.log(dsq.countMonths(someDay, someOtherDay, false)); // 47
```

<a name="isBetweenDates"/></a>
### Check if a date is between two other dates
```javascript
dsq.isBetweenDates(test,start,end)
```

Checks to see if a date falls between two other dates and returns `true` if it is. Being on the first or last day is considered within the range.

| test | The date to check | Date Object | `new Date()` |
| start | The start of the range to check | Date Object | `new Date()` |
| end | The end of the range to check | Date Object | `new Date()` |


```javascript
const someDay = new Date(2000, 0, 20),
    someOtherDay = new Date(2003, 11, 21),
    thatDay = new Date(2002, 7, 15);
console.log(dsq.isBetweenDates(thatDay,someDay,someOtherDay)); // true
```

<a name="isSameDay"/></a>
### Check if two dates are the same day
```javascript
dsq.isSameDay(date1,date2)
```

Checks to see if a date is the on the same **day** (and same month & year) as another date and returns `true` if it is.

| Argument | Description | Type | Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| date1 | The first date to check | Date Object | `new Date()` |
| date2 | The second date to check | Date Object | `new Date()` |

```javascript
const someDay = new Date(2000, 0, 20),
    someOtherDay = new Date(2003, 11, 21);
console.log(dsq.isSameDay(someDay,someOtherDay)); // false
```

<a name="daysInMonth"/></a>
### Get days in a month
```javascript
dsq.daysInMonth(year,month)
```

Returns the number of days in any given month. It accounts for leap years. 

| Argument | Description | Type | Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| year | The year containing the month to check | Number | 1899, 1900, 1901, ..., 2999 |
| month | The month to check | Number | 0, 1, 2,..., 11 |

```javascript
const year = 2000, 
    month = 1; // February
console.log(dsq.daysInMonth(year,month)); // 29 (Leap year)
```

<a name="dayOfYear"/></a>
### Get the day of the year
```javascript
dsq.dayOfYear(date)
```

Returns the number of a day in its year from a date object, between 1 and 366 (where January the 1st === `1`, December the 31st in 2000 would return `366` [leap year] & while December 31st 2003 would return `365`.
